# ðŸ‘¾ Earth Defender: Void Assault

> Earth Defender is a space-themed base defense game where the player controls a ship and must face waves of alien enemies. The objective is to kill all the enemies, defeating them and collecting items that improve the base.
The game consists of a 2d map, where enemies appear randomly shooting at the base, and you are the soldier responsible for stopping the enemies and protecting the base

## Implemented Features
- `Moviment`: The player controls the spaceship using the **right mouse button**;
- `Shot`: The player's ship can shoot using the **Q** key. The shooting frequency is controlled by a time interval;

- `Menu`: A main menu where player can start a **new game**, learn **how to play**, choose **difficulty**, and **exit** the game;
- `Base`: A base that the player must defend from incoming waves of enemies. The player can freely leave the base;
- `Sniper Enemy`: An enemy that randomly appears from the ledges that follow the player shoot towards it;
- `Kamikaze Enemy`: A special type of enemy that self-destructs upon colliding with something, causing significant damage;
- `Alien Boss`: This is the final challenge you will have to face to win the game;
- `Item Drop System`: When defeating enemies, there is a chance they will drop items. These could be **base upgrades, health, or ammo**;
- `Choice of Difficulty`: 3 difficulty levels, allowing players to choose between **Normal, Hard or Impossible**;
- `Automatic Difficulty Increase`: As the game progresses, the difficulty automatically increases;
- `Status Bar`: A status bar displayed on the screen, providing real-time information about the current state of entities.
